Synthetic Cloud & Shadow Segmentation using U-Net (Bachelor Thesis)

This repository contains my Bachelor’s Thesis titled “Synthetic Cloud and Shadow Segmentation using U-Net”, completed as part of my Computer Science degree.

The thesis focuses on generating synthetic satellite imagery using Perlin Noise and training a U-Net model to detect cloud-covered and shadow-affected regions at a pixel level. Evaluation was performed using IoU and Dice Score metrics on a held-out synthetic dataset.

🔍 Key Results

U-Net trained using synthetic data generated from Perlin Noise

Achieved IoU = 0.87 and Dice Score = 0.93 on test samples

Clouds were segmented more accurately compared to shadows
